-  I bring a strong foundation to hardware and engineering projects.
-  Interested in **IoT**, **embedded systems**, **smart grid tech**, and **solar energy systems**.
-  Actively building projects that blend **software and electrical engineering** principles.
-  Reach me at **dtyasinmax@gmail.com** for collaboration or questions!

##  What I'm Learning

Iâ€™m committed to mastering both **hardware systems** and **modern software engineering**, with an emphasis on high-performance and scalable backend + embedded development:

| Language     | Purpose                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Rust         | Safe systems programming & embedded        |
| Go (Golang)  | Backend microservices & concurrency        |
| TypeScript   | Typed frontend/backend apps (React/Node)   |
| SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL) | Relational data modeling & querying |
| Kotlin       | Android and cross-platform dev             |
| C++          | Performance-critical EE/IoT applications   |

I also continue to sharpen my Java, Python, JavaScript, and MATLAB skills as part of my academic and project work.
